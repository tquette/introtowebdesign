    <li> Step 1: </li>
    <p>
      Open up Illustrator
      </p>
    <li> Step 2: </li>
    <p>
      Click on file, then new and scroll over to
      the print tab and then click create
      </p>
    <li> Step 3: </li>
    <p>
      On the left hand side, there will be a tool
      bar the one being used is going to be the
      rectangle tool, except we are going to
      right click that tool and use the ellipse
      tool
      </p>
    <li> Step 4: </li>
    <p>
      Starting off in the middle of thepage we
      are going to make a circle so hold down the
      shift key and drag out the mouse in order
      to form a circle
      </p>
    <li> Step 5: </li>
    <p>
      Using the rectangle tool again, right Click
      and use the polygon shape and again, hold
      down the shift key and create the polygon
      shape in the middle of the circle
      </p>
    <li> Step 6: </li>
    <p>
      Then there will be a line tool that looks
      like a / and we are going to click on that
      tool and starting from the corners of the
      polygon, you're going to extend the lines
      from touching the corner of the polygon
      to reach the end of the circle.
      </p>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        </li>
        <!-- unordered list gives you bullet points -->
        </ul>
